            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
            compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
            is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
            non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
            CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
            multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
            object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
            programming) styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object
            construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic
            script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and
            Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions
            store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).
